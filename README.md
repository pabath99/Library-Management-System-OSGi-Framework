Introduction

Our project presents an innovative library management system, developed within the Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) framework. This advanced system is segmented into four key components:

• Inventory Management: Facilitates the addition, removal, and viewing of books and other inventory items, streamlining the organization of library resources.
• Staff Management: Allows for the comprehensive handling of staff records, including adding, removing, and viewing staff members, thereby enhancing administrative efficiency.
• Book Reservation: Offers a robust platform for managing book reservations, enabling users to add, remove, and view bookings, thus improving the accessibility of library materials.
• Customer Management: Empowers libraries to manage their customer databases effectively, with features for adding, removing, and viewing customer information, ensuring a personalized user experience.

Leveraging the modular and dynamic capabilities of the OSGi framework, our library management system is designed for flexibility and scalability, accommodating the evolving needs of modern libraries.
